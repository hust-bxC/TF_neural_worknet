    "Thursday, April 4, 2019 (4:30 - 6:20pm)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Lab rules\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Please read the instructions and problem prompts **carefully**.  Be sure to solve the problem the way it is asked (i.e. are you supposed to define a function?  Catch exceptions?  Use a particular construct?)  Solutions that \"work\", but are not composed according to the directions will not receive [full] credit\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  This lab is to be done *individually*. You may talk to your fellow classmates about general issues (*\"Remind me again: What's the difference between a parameter and an argument?\"*) but not about the specifics of how to do these exercises.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  Along a similar vein, you can ask the TA for help, but ask questions about **concepts**.  (i.e. *\"I donâ€™t understand how the else block works\"*, not \"*my program isnâ€™t doing what I want\"*).  The TA is there to help, but not to do your work for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  You are welcome to use the class resources and the Internet. But try to google for *concepts*, not your specific tasks.  The goal for you to begin to start thinking algorithmically, and hopefully memorize a little syntax by osmosis. If you just blindly do the exercises, without actually *thinking* about them, the next time you see something related but slightly altered â€” like, say, on an exam â€” you wonâ€™t be able to solve the problem. So avoid brainlessly cutting and pasting code snippets.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.  Play with variations. Solve one of the problems, and then copy the code to a new cell and play around with it. Experiment! Break stuff! Doing this is **the single most important thing** when learning a programming language.\n",
    "\n",
    "6.  When you have finished all the exercises, let the TA know, and he will check your work.  Presuming youâ€™ve done things correctly, youâ€™re free to go.\n",
    "\n",
    "7.  Have fun!\n",
    "\n",

    "In this lab, we're going to modify our code from Lab 9, and add database support to it.  We're going to basically obtain the same data, but in addition to creating Python objects (lists, dicts, etc.) we're going to store our data in a database.  Keep that in mind when you're doinh problem 1; you're going to want to store the data in a way that makes it straightforward to iterate across the data and add elements to database tables you create.  I would advise you to read through the entire lab prompt before starting! "

But the class is a completely differnet entity, so we store that in a different table.  Keep in mind the lecture on databases: we don't want to store repeated info.  If some entity can exist multiple times in different rows of some other entity, then it might need it's own table.\n",

Then I'd have a *class* table, to store information for each class.  That would contain a class name (string), a class number (integer), and a primary key ID (integer).  Finally, I'd have a *schedule* table, where the rows would be what class each student would be in.
